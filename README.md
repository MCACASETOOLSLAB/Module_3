This software is intended to provide small working example of PROCESS SYNCRONIZATION.This is explained here diagramatically. The modules strive to be simple, well documented and modification friendly to help users to quickly learn the basic concept of process syncronization-critical section, semaphore, busy waiting, spinlock, etc., with a little reading and idea.

This software had been developed in DOS BOX TurboC++.

This module  will create a process(car) as a process and then ersae the car after process is completed.

But it will provide better result when we execute it with other two modules(The whole process is divided in three modules in which semaphores, busy waiting, spinlocks, monitors, critical section,etc are shown).

Now you can read the code and its comments and see the result,do experiment with it, and hopefully quickly grasp how things work.

If you find a problem, incorrect comment, obsolete or improper code or such, please let me know
